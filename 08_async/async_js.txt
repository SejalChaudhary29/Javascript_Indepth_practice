1. Javascript  ------->by default ->  1. synchronous  2. single-threaded language
 a)synchronous -> executing the code one by one
 b)single threaded lang -> on one thread all the code will be executed



Javascript engine will always found with the browser runtime environment and nodejs runtime environment

2. Excecution context
In a execution context one line of code execute at a time
|
|--> console.log('I am first)
|
|
|--> console.log('I am Second)
|
|

//I am first
//I am Second


3. Blocking code vs Non-blocking code

blocking code -> it blocks the flow of code // read file sync
non- blocking code -> doest not blocks the flow // read file async
